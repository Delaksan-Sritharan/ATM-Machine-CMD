How to Run
To run this project, follow these steps:

Prerequisites:

Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher installed on your system. You can download it from Oracle's website.

Clone the Repository (if applicable):
If this project is hosted on a version control system (e.g., Git), clone it to your local machine:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>

Otherwise, ensure you have all the Java source files (.java) in a designated directory.

Compile the Java Source Files:
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your .java files are located, and compile them:

javac Main.java BankAccount.java ATM.java Transaction.java # Add all your .java files here

Note: Replace Main.java, BankAccount.java, ATM.java, and Transaction.java with the actual names of your primary Java source files.

Run the Application:
After successful compilation, run the main class:

java Main

The ATM CLI will then prompt you for your account number and PIN.

Dependencies
This project uses standard Java libraries and does not have any external dependencies beyond the JDK.

Project Structure
A typical project structure might look like this:

atm-cli-java/
├── src/
│   ├── Main.java             # Entry point of the application
│   ├── ATM.java              # Handles ATM logic and user interaction
│   ├── BankAccount.java      # Represents a bank account with balance and account info
│   ├── Transaction.java      # (Optional) Represents a single transaction
│   └── util/                 # (Optional) Package for utility classes
│       └── InputHandler.java # (Optional) Handles user input parsing
└── README.md

Future Enhancements
Database Integration: Store account data and transaction history persistently using a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL).

Multiple Accounts: Support for multiple user accounts.

More Transaction Types: Add options like fund transfers, bill payments.

Enhanced Security: Implement more robust authentication and session management.

Logging: Add logging to record transactions and system events.

Improved UI: While still CLI, make the output more visually appealing (e.g., using ASCII art for branding).

Unit Tests: Write unit tests for core functionalities.
